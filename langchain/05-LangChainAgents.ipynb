It was opened to employees in April 2017, while construction was still underway. It replaced Apple Campus as the company's corporate headquarters.\n",
      "The main building's scale and circular groundscraper design, by Norman Foster, has earned the structure the media nickname \"the spaceship\". Located on a suburban site totaling 1.46 km2 (360 acres), it houses more than 12,000 employees in one central four-story circular building of approximately 0.26 km2 (64 acres). Apple co-founder Steve Jobs wanted the campus to look less like a business park and more like a nature refuge; 80 percent of the site consists of green space planted with drought-resistant trees and plants indigenous to the Cupertino area, and the center courtyard of the main building features an artificial pond.\n",

      "Summary: Apple Corps Limited is a British multimedia company that was established in London by the members of the Beatles in the 1960s to form a conglomerate. The company's name, pronounced \"apple core\", is a pun. Its chief division is Apple Records, which was launched in 1968. Other divisions included Apple Electronics, Apple Films, Apple Publishing, and Apple Retail, with the latter's most notable venture being the short-lived Apple Boutique on the corner of Baker Street and Paddington Street in London.\n",
      "Apple's headquarters during the late 1960s was on the upper floors of 94 Baker Street, then at 95 Wigmore Street, and subsequently at 3 Savile Row. The last of these addresses was also known as the Apple Building, which was home to the Apple studio. From 1970 to 2007, Apple's chief executive was former Beatles road manager Neil Aspinall, although he did not officially bear the CEO title until Allen Klein had left the company. In April 2007, Jeff Jones became the chief executive. In 2010, Apple Corps ranked number two on the Fast Company magazine's list of the world's most innovative companies in the music industry, thanks to the release of The Beatles: Rock Band video game and the remastering of the Beatles' catalogue.\u001b[0m\n",
